# TCP-Server-Performance
• Analyzed the performance of synchronous and asynchronous TCP servers.
  implemented concurrent TCP server programs utilizing multiple processes (fork),
  threads (pthreads), and non-blocking I/O multiplexing techniques (select, poll, epoll).
• Performed experiments with up to 1,000 concurrent connections, capturing network
  packets using Wireshark to measure and compare average throughput and latency across
  various server configurations
